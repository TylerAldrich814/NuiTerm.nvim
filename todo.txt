             - Features -
 - I like Oil's Help screen menu via 'g?'
   Maybe do something similar? i.e., 't?'
   Where We bring up a Keymap Helper window?

 - MainWindow Padding - Add UI feature to have padding between inner MainWindow
   and TermWindow.
    This could be implemented by taking the padding values and caculating TermWindow's
    width,height,row,col based on MainWindows width,height,row,col then passing said 
    values into termConfig.
   Reason: The TabBar is too damn close to the termwindow -- This could look a lot better.
